## Welcome to Team A's project: Restaurant Reviews in Mississauga!

To start the webapp, run from the root folder:
```
python3 webapp.py perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu [port]
```

Navigate to the default route and begin to explore restaurants in Mississauga!

If needed, the database authentication details are:
```python
    user = 'safdarh'
    password = 'python986lion'
```

## Known Bugs
  * Some values for Today's Hours are incorrectly formatted in the database.
  * Line breaks for reviews are also not included in the database.
  * Empty searches/low minimum star searches can take time. Backend query code is built for modularity and extension.
